In today’s fast-paced airline industry, efficient customer service is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. The call center plays a pivotal role in addressing customer concerns, but inefficient processes can result in long Average Handle Time (AHT) and Average Speed to Answer (AST), leading to frustrated customers and high operational costs.

This project focuses on optimizing United Airlines’ Interactive Voice Response (IVR) operations by analyzing customer-agent interactions, predicting primary call reasons, and identifying areas where automation, such as self-service IVR systems, can reduce agent workload. The ultimate goal is to improve both AHT and AST metrics, ensuring quicker resolution of customer inquiries and a more efficient allocation of call center resources.
